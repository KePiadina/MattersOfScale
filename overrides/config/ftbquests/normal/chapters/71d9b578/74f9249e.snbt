		"You may have noticed there's a huge number of seeds and crops, along with various food items. To help you mass prepare food there's Cooking for Blockheads.",
		"Each block contributes to a \"kitchen\" multiblock, similar to a storage network but for food.",
		"",
		"More complex foods will, of course, give more hunger and saturation. Top tier items will also give buffs.",
		"",
		"Unlike other modpacks, there isn't a real incentive beyond perfectionism to craft every single food item, so you could eat bread from stone age to infinity gear.",
		"You will need to cultivate everything by the endgame, though. Craft a Market, if you need to."
